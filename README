The requirements for running RFECS are:
gcc 4.4.6 20120305 (Red Hat 4.4.6-4)
matlab 2012a 

There are two interactive options available:
1.Train as well as predict
run:   ./train_and_predict
2. Predict only
run:    ./predict_only

Input requirements:

1. Train and Predict
Input for this is:
1.ChIP-seq histone modification bed files and corresponding Inputs
Example- H1_bed_files
2. A text file indicating location and name of ChIP-seq bed files
Example- histone_H1_files.txt 
The format is:
Mark	name_of_mark	number_of_replicates
mark_replicate1
input_replicate1
mark_replicate2
input_replicate2
....
....
3.If the cell-type for prediction is different from cell-type,then chip-seq bed files and names of bed files should be provided separately for this 
4. training set representing enhancers (active p300 for example)
example- training_set/H1_p300_training_sites.txt.hg19 
5.training set for background:
option A: define your own background
option B (recommended): provide a list of all known p300 binding sites and active TSS.
Ex- training_set/H1_p300_all_sites.txt.hg19 and training_set/H1_active_tss.hg19
if your build is not hg19 or hg18, then also provide :
- chromosome description file of the format of with coordinates. Format as hg18_chrom.bed and hg19_chrom.bed
- a list of all TSS in the UCSC/refseq database for that build.format : chr	TSS	strand
- chromosome you would like to use for background (mid-length such as chr10 for humans) 

2. Predict only
1. Select the trained model. Examples are available in trained_forests for sets of 3 marks or all 24 marks.
Paste the trained model mat-file to forest_p300_tssbg.mat in this directory
2.If build is not hg19 or hg18, provide a chromsome description file of the format hg19_chrom.bed

Examples:

To test the working, run the program using H1 bed files in the directory H1_bed_files using hg19 build, histone_H1_files.txt and other training set examples

you can "train_and_predict" or "predict_only" by copying trained_forests/H1_forest_p300_tssbg_k4me1_k4me2_k4me3.mat to forest_p300_tssbg.mat

The results should be similar to H1_enhancers_k4me.txt

(train and predict_only scripts were modified so that they are now non-interactive and suits better to triton environment.) Gokcen
